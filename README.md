Linked lists allocate memory for data dynamically, rather than statically like arrays. The list progresses sequentially with a root and its connected nodes. Each node structure consists of a data (e.g., integer, 4 bytes) and a pointer (4 bytes). The pointers point to the address of the data in the next node. This allows data to be stored dynamically in memory.

In this code, I implemented a singly linked list in the C programming language.
